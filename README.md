# IWOZERE

An ongoing project for Android devices - a geolocated messaging application that allows the user to create short, permanent, anonymous messages and 'pin' them to their current Google map locations.  A type of digital graffiti.  The message is pushed  to other users devices who are within the immediate vicinity, facilitating a kind of anonymous conversation.  Messages can be upvoted and a user may view popular messages or the most recent messages. Users can navigate the map to any other location around the globe to view messages that have been posted there, but may only post a message themselves at the location they are currently at. Locations that have had a lot of messages posted there in the past 24 hours are highlighted on the map.
